# 8086 Assemly projects (2017 autumn)
University related projects written in assembly language. A range of simple tasks and one disassembly project

## Skills aquired after working with assembly tasks:

- Base knowledge of how computers operate.
- Understanding specifics of how memory and registers operate.
- Understanding binary/hexadecimal numbers and converting to/from decimal.
- Practical skills of algorithms. What could be a simple task in C had to be written as a couple hundred lines in assembly.
- Writing a dissasembly (something like decompiler) program which takes in executable bytes and translates them into assembly language.
